# Personal Assistant â€“ Django Web App

## Overview

I am working on this Project to learn Django day by day so its updating frequently and there might be mistakes etc.

This is a Django-based personal assistant web application designed to help users manage their daily productivity. It provides user authentication and personal dashboards to track:

- Tasks
- Reminders
- Daily Plans
...
Each user gets a personalized experience with their own data â€” tasks, schedules, and reminders are tied to their account.
